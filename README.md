neon-modules
============

Repo added to organize modules created for Neon DSL. The purpose is to manage useful modules and to try to not repeat code by keeping the modules independent from each other but to keep them useful between Classes at the same time.

Modules added so far:

* NodeSupport
* EventSupport
* CustomEventSupport
* ChildrenSupport
* AnimationSupport
